# CMake Project File

The entry point for a CMake project is a file called `CMakeLists.txt`.

Let's set up the main `CMakeLists.txt` in the project root folder.

You will need the following commands:
- [`cmake_minimum_required`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/command/cmake_minimum_required.html)
- [`project`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.10/command/project.html)
